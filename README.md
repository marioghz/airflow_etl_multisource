<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project's intention is to define a code base for ETL processes, using different techniques and technologies to perform a simple data load isolated from the Python code within the Apache Airflow orchestrator. This design architecture allows some of the following features:

Some of them:

* Separate .py document for each payload type
* Parallelism of data loading in Airflow
* Control and reuse of BDs connection methods
* Development speed
* More efficient error identification


Ideally, the project seeks to grow and improve in features and new data sources within the same Apache Airflow environment as a Python execution manager, in addition to reinforcing what has to do with the security, error handling and scalability of the project.
